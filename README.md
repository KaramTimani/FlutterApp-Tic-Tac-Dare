Tic-Tac-Dare

Tic Tac Toe with Dare feature is a mobile game developed for Android and iOS devices using the Flutter framework. It's a 2 player game where players take turns to play Tic Tac Toe. When a player loses the game, the app will present the player with a dare which he must complete before being able to continue playing the game with the other player. The project aims to develop a fun and engaging Tic Tac Toe game that incorporates a unique dare feature to make the game more interesting. The final deliverables will be a working Tic Tac Toe app for Android and iOS devices.
